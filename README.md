# 📘 University Management System

## 📌 Project Description

The **University Management System** is a web-based application developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that demonstrates the implementation of a **Hash Table data structure** in a real-world scenario. This project allows users to manage university records efficiently through core operations such as **Insert, Delete, Display, and Find**.

The system uses a custom-built `HashTable` class in JavaScript with **separate chaining** to handle collisions. Each university record is stored as an object containing the following attributes:

- **Key** (Unique Identifier)
- **Rank**
- **University Name**
- **Location**
- **Course Count**
- **Courses Offered**
